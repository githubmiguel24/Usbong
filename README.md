Usbong is a programming language designed to strike a balance between precision and clarity, ensuring that programs remain well-structured yet readable. 
It follows consistent, well-defined rules that make programming predictable while maintaining simplicity and accessibility for programmers.
The language's keywords and reserved words are drawn from Filipino words centered around the theme of planting and farming. 
For example, keywords like ugat (main), ani (print), and tanim (scan input), symbolize the concept of nurturing logic and cultivating knowledge 
through code. Usbong is rooted in the theme of growth and learning, a nurturing programming language that helps logic skills sprout and 
grow naturally. Usbong budded from the languages C and  Java, taking in features such as a concise set of control structures and keyword library, 
as well as well-defined expression evaluation shaped into a simple, cohesive design. These features all work together to create a language that is 
flexible and rooted in clarity. It encourages programmers to grow their logic one line of code at a time, hence dubbed "Usbong: Grow your logic".
